# 🎓 College Placement Management System – Frontend

This is the **frontend** for a college-specific Placement Management System built with **Next.js (JavaScript)**. The application delivers a responsive, role-based, and intuitive interface for students, placement officers (admins), and company HRs to manage end-to-end campus placement workflows — from job drives to final selection.

> ⚠️ Note: This repository contains **only the frontend code**. The backend (Express.js) is available in a separate repository.
